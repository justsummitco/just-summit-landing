    question: "When does Summit launch?",
    answer: "Summit is currently in development with a planned launch in Q2 2025. Early-adopter pre-order customers will get beta access 2-3 months before the public launch, giving you first access to test and provide feedback."
  },
  {
    question: "How will I access my included subscription time?",
    answer: "Once Summit launches, your account will automatically be upgraded to Premium for the duration included in your pre-order (1, 6, or 12 months). You'll receive an email with login instructions and your premium features will be immediately available."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after my included months end?",
    answer: "After your included premium time expires, you can continue using Summit with our standard pricing (approximately Â£12.99/month for premium features). There's no obligation to continue, and you'll always have access to basic features."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a refund policy?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer a 30-day no-risk guarantee. If Summit doesn't improve your learning experience within 30 days of launch, we'll provide a full refund of your pre-order. No questions asked, no hassle."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I influence the roadmap?",
    answer: "Early-adopters get exclusive access to our product development process. Advanced and Professional pre-order customers can join monthly product-shaping calls where you'll directly influence features, priorities, and the overall direction of Summit. Your feedback shapes the product."
