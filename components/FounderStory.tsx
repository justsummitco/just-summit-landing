                <p>
                  <strong>2014.</strong> A single moment changed everything. The car accident left me in a coma, 
                  and when I woke up, my memory was shattered. Simple conversations became impossible. 
                  Reading felt like trying to hold water in my hands.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  During the long months of recovery, audiobooks and podcasts became my lifeline. 
                  When my eyes couldn't focus on text, my ears could still learn. But there was a crushing problem: 
                  <strong>I couldn't remember anything I'd heard.</strong>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Hours of content would vanish from my mind like morning mist. The frustration was overwhelming. 
                  Here I was, desperate to rebuild my cognitive abilities, but traditional learning methods 
                  had completely failed me.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-primary-600 font-semibold bg-primary-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-primary-500">
                  That's when I discovered something profound: My brain injury had given me the same challenges 
                  that millions of people with ADHD face every day. The techniques I developed to overcome 
                  my memory loss were exactly what ADHD brains had always needed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Through trial, error, and relentless experimentation, I developed a system: 
                  <strong>instant capture, spaced repetition, and bite-sized summaries.</strong> 
                  Instead of trying to remember everything, I learned to capture the essential moments 
                  and review them in a way that actually stuck.

                <p>
                  Summit isn't just an appâ€”it's the culmination of a decade-long journey to understand 
                  how memory actually works when your brain doesn't follow the "normal" rules. 
                  Every feature exists because someone like us told me what they needed.
